# Cross Publishing Scala Example

[![cross Scala version support](https://index.scala-lang.org/toniogela/cross/cross/latest.svg)](https://index.scala-lang.org/toniogela/cross/cross) ![CI](https://github.com/TonioGela/cross/workflows/Continuous%20Integration/badge.svg)

This repository is meant to be a Scala cross-publishing example and comes with [a companion article](https://toniogela.dev/cross-library)

It relies heavily on [sbt-typelevel](https://github.com/typelevel/sbt-typelevel) and uses [this approach](https://typelevel.org/sbt-typelevel/secrets.html) to publish to Maven Central.
